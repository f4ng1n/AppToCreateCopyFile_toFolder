# AppToCreateCopyFile_toFolder
The User application has the following functionality: when launched, the user is prompted to enter information that will be saved as a test file in his directory (valuable object). Further, it is possible to create a copy of the recorded file in a public directory (public object).

This application addresses a threat to the security of information. The implementation of threats to the confidentiality of information often occurs using an adverse **information flow**. There are two main types of information flows: *memory* and *time*. In this app, an unfavorable information flow is simulated from *memory* (Fig. 1).
